# cofidectl debug container

This is a debug container that is used by [`cofidectl`](https://www.github.com/cofide/cofidectl) to discover the SPIFFE SVID and trust bundle issued to a workload, as part of the `cofidectl workload status` command. It helps to debug a running workload in a cluster and ensure it's identity is as intended.

Cofide provide a ready-made container image used by `cofidectl` but you may wish to [build](#build) your own.

## Prerequisites

Building a `cofidectl-debug-container` binary requires:

* [Go 1.23 toolchain](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner
* [`ko`](https://github.com/ko-build/ko) to build container images

## Build

To run the unit tests and build the `cofidectl-debug-container` binary:

```sh
just build-release
```

## How it works

With `cofidectl`, this container is executed in-cluster as a Kubernetes [ephemeral container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/). The Go application interfaces with the [SPIFFE Workload API](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE_Workload_API.md) to obtain the SPIFFE SVID and trust bundle issued to a workload. `cofidectl` prints this to the console - for example:

```
./cofidectl workload status foo --namespace demo --pod-name ping-pong-client-f6f6495b5-zb9bd --trust-zone cofide-a
âœ… Complete: Successfully executed emphemeral container in ping-pong-client-f6f6495b5-zb9bd
